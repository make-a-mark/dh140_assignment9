Within this assignment, I utilized the CORGIS dataset to grab information in the form of a csv on video game completion times. Using this data, I practiced using the pandas and matplotlib libraries.

Some of the plots I created include:
* A bar chart of the max playtime of the top video games per year (2004-2008)
* Bar charts for each of consoles' top video games (a review over 90)
* A collective, aggregated bar chart with all of the top video games for all consoles, color-coded
* Histograms for each of the consoles with frequencies of each of the top reviewed games
